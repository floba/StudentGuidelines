# StudentGuidelines

by Florian Bauer

I created these guidelines for student reports, theses and presentations, because I saw reoccurring mistakes. With the guide, already the first version of a student's work should be in a higher quality. I intend to keep the repository updated, as I see further reoccurring mistakes. The guidelines also include templates for reports and thesis written at the Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics at Technical University of Munich (TUM), see Appendix A.A in GuidelinesStudentsReportsAndTheses.pdf and the LaTeX source GuidelinesStudentsReportsAndTheses.tex. The guidelines may also help for papers and other scientific publications.

As a PhD student, I see myself in a learning process and I am constantly trying to improve my own style of scientific writing and presenting. So feedback is more than welcome! If you see anything in the guidelines that should be changed, let me know. I can also invite you to edit the repository directly.
